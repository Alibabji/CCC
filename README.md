# Canadian Computing Competition
The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is a fun challenge for participants with an interest in programming. Designed to be both accessible to participants with some programming experience and to challenge the keenest programmers at the secondary school level, the CCC helps participants build confidence and grow their ability to design, understand and implement algorithms

## Audience
Participants may choose to write either the Junior or Senior level of the competition. We recommend that participants and teachers follow these guidelines:
- Junior level any participant with beginner programming skills
- Senior level any participant with intermediate to advanced programming skills
Approximately 20 of the top participants from the Senior level of the CCC are invited to the Canadian Computing Olympiad (CCO) at the University of Waterloo.

## Date
The CCC is held online in February. The CCO is invitation-only and held in May. Visit https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/our-contests.html)https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/our-contests.html for dates and deadlines for the current year.

## Content
The Junior competition begins with straightforward topics like basic loops and conditions and progresses to advanced material, like recursion, two-dimensional arrays and efficient or clever algorithms. The Senior competition increases in difficulty from basic algorithms to more advanced algorithms, like careful counting and some mathematical reasoning, with the final question typically involving material at the level of the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).

## Contest Supervision
- Contest Supervisors should arrange to have participants write the contest at school and are responsible for ensuring that participants are supervised appropriately.
- This contest is written using the https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/computing-grader.html. Contest Supervisors will need to authenticate their participants in order for them to gain access.
- Participants and supervisors are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the system prior to the official contest date.
- All participants and teachers should familiarize themselves with the https://cccgrader.com/rules.pdf
- Results will be available in the https://cemc2.math.uwaterloo.ca/contest/Sigma/school/supervisorPortal.php in the weeks after the contest date.
